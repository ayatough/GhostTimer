# Feature Specification: Windows Desktop Timer Widget

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`  
**Created**: 2025-09-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want to make Windows desktop widget powered by Rust. Following is spec. # ÃokjXÄø§ﬁ¸¢◊Í - Åˆö©"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   í Extracted: Windows desktop timer widget with transparency and background adaptation
2. Extract key concepts from description
   í Identified: actors (video viewers), actions (timer control), data (timer state), constraints (transparency, minimal interference)
3. For each unclear aspect:
   í Marked specific areas needing clarification
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   í User flow: start timer during video watching, non-intrusive operation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   í Each requirement is testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities (timer state and configuration)
7. Run Review Checklist
   í Some [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] items require user input
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ° Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user watching full-screen YouTube videos needs to set and monitor cooking/study timers without the timer interface blocking or disrupting their viewing experience. The timer should be visible but unobtrusive, blending into the background until interaction is needed.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is watching a full-screen video, **When** they activate the timer widget, **Then** the timer appears as a semi-transparent overlay that doesn't block video content
2. **Given** the timer is running in the background, **When** the user hovers over the timer display, **Then** the timer becomes more opaque for easy reading and shows control buttons
3. **Given** the timer reaches zero, **When** the countdown completes, **Then** the user receives a notification that doesn't interrupt their video playback
4. **Given** the timer is displayed, **When** the user drags the timer display, **Then** the timer moves to a new position and remembers that location
5. **Given** the timer is running, **When** the user right-clicks on the timer, **Then** a context menu appears with options to pause, reset, or configure the timer

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user's desktop background changes color dramatically?
- How does the system handle multiple monitor setups?
- What occurs if the timer application loses focus or the system goes to sleep?
- How does the timer behave during high-contrast mode or accessibility settings?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a countdown timer that remains visible over all other applications
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to set timer duration in minutes and seconds
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide start, pause, and reset timer controls
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain semi-transparent appearance (default 70% transparency) to avoid blocking background content
- **FR-005**: System MUST increase opacity on mouse hover for improved visibility during interaction
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to drag and reposition the timer display anywhere on screen
- **FR-007**: System MUST remember the timer's last position between application sessions
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide audio and/or visual notification when timer reaches zero
- **FR-009**: System MUST offer right-click context menu for settings and application control
- **FR-010**: System MUST run with minimal system resource usage to avoid impacting video playback performance
- **FR-011**: System MUST adapt text color automatically [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific algorithm for background color detection and contrast calculation]
- **FR-012**: System MUST support hotkey controls [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which specific hotkeys and what actions they trigger]
- **FR-013**: System MUST provide notification system [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: system tray, toast notifications, or both?]
- **FR-014**: Users MUST be able to configure transparency levels [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific range and increments for transparency adjustment]
- **FR-015**: System MUST switch between display modes [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: exact criteria for automatic mode switching vs manual control]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Timer State**: Current countdown value, running/paused status, original duration setting
- **Configuration**: User preferences for transparency level, position, notification settings, hotkey assignments
- **Display Context**: Current background color information, contrast settings, monitor configuration
